# Social Network API

## Description

User Story: \
AS A social media startup \
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database \
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data \
<br>
I learned a lot about Mongo and how NoSQL databases differ from SQL databases.

## Installation

First I ran "npm install" to install the dependencies. Then I connected to the Mongo database in Compass. \
After seeding the database, I ran "node server.js" to activate the server on port 3001.

## Usage

I used Insomnia to test the routes and Compass to house the database.
